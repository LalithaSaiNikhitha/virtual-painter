# Virtual Painter
Virtual Painter is a Python-based project that allows users to create digital paintings using hand gestures detected by a webcam. This project leverages computer vision techniques to track hand movements and interpret gestures for painting on a virtual canvas.

## Features
Hand gesture detection and tracking

Drawing on a virtual canvas

Color and brush size selection

Eraser functionality

Save drawings to the computer
## Usage
Ensure you have a webcam connected.

Run the main Python script to start the virtual painter:
python painter.py

Follow the on-screen instructions and use hand gestures to draw on the virtual canvas
